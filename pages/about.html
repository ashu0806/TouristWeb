                        Lucknow Metro is a rapid transit system which started its operations from 6 September 2017.
                        Lucknow Metro system is the most-quickly built metro system in the world[128] and most
                        economical high-speed rapid transit system project in India. The commencement of civil

                        state capital. It is divided into two corridors the North-south corridor connecting Munshipulia
                        to CCS International Airport and the East-west corridor connecting Charbagh Railway Station to
                        Vasant Kunj. This will be the most expensive public transport system in the state but will
                        provide a rapid means of mass transport to decongest traffic on city roads. Construction of the
                        first phase will be complete by March 2017. The completion of metro rail project is the primary
                        object of Uttar Pradesh government currently headed by the chief minister Yogi Adityanath . On 5
                        September 2017, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and CM Yogi Adityanath showed green flag to the
                        Lucknow Metro.
