                    Lucknow is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh,and is also
                    the administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and division. Having a population of
                    2.8
                    million as per 2011 census, it is the eleventh most populous city and the twelfth-most populous
                    urban
                    agglomeration of India. Lucknow has always been a multicultural city that flourished as a North
                    Indian
                    cultural and artistic hub, and the seat of power of Nawabs in the 18th and 19th centuries. It
                    continues to be an important centre of governance, administration, education, commerce,
                    aerospace,
                    finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, culture, tourism, music and poetry.

                    The city stands at an elevation of approximately 123 metres (404 ft) above sea level. Lucknow
                    city
                    had
                    an area of 402 km2 till December 2019, when 88 villages were added to the municipal limits and
                    the
                    area
                    increased to 631 km2. Bounded on the east by Barabanki, on the west by Unnao, on the south by
                    Raebareli and in the north by Sitapur and Hardoi, Lucknow sits on the northwestern shore of the
                    Gomti
                    River. As of 2008, there were 110 wards in the city. Morphologically, three clear demarcations
                    exist:
                    The Central business district, which is a fully built up area, comprises Hazratganj, Aminabad
                    and
                    Chowk.
                    A middle zone surrounds the inner zone with cement houses while the outer zone consists of
                    slums.

                    Historically, Lucknow was the capital of the Awadh region, controlled by the Delhi Sultanate and
                    later
                    the Mughal Empire. It was transferred to the Nawabs of Awadh. In 1856, the British East India
                    Company
                    abolished local rule and took complete control of the city along with the rest of Awadh and, in
                    1857,
                    transferred it to the British Raj. Along with the rest of India, Lucknow became independent from
                    Britain on 15 August 1947. It has been listed as the 17th-fastest growing city in India and 74th
                    in
                    the
                    world.

                    Lucknow, along with Agra and Varanasi, is in the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a chain of survey
                    triangulations created by the Government of Uttar Pradesh to boost tourism in the state.

                        This massive gate is situated between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara. This place is generally
                        very
                        much busy all day, and during weekends most of the tourists visit. The streets are redeveloped
                        as it
                        was earlier constructed of hard brick roadways.The design of the gate represents the most famous
                        industry for which the city Lucknow itself is known for - 'Chikankaari'. When the gate is looked
                        upside down it resembles the v shaped neckline used in chikan clothings.
