                <div class="history-page-content">
                    From 1350 onwards, Lucknow and parts of the Awadh region were ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, Sharqi
                    Sultanate, Mughal Empire, Nawabs of Awadh, the British East India Company and the British Raj.

                    For about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), Awadh was part of the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur.
                    Emperor Humayun made it a part of the Mughal Empire around 1555. Emperor Jahangir (1569–1627)
                    granted an estate in Awadh to a favoured nobleman, Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who later built Machchi
                    Bhawan on this estate. It later became the seat of power from where his descendants, the
                    Sheikhzadas, controlled the region.

                    The Nawabs of Lucknow, in reality, the Nawabs of Awadh, acquired the name after the reign of the
                    third Nawab when Lucknow became their capital. The city became North India's cultural capital, and
                    its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts.
                    Under their dominion, music and dance flourished, and construction of numerous monuments took
                    place. Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chota Imambara, and the Rumi
                    Darwaza are notable examples. One of the Nawab's enduring legacies is the region's syncretic
                    Hindu–Muslim culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb.


                    Gates of the Palace at Lucknow by W. Daniell, 1801

                    Chota Imambara is a Shia Muslim Hussainiya and a mausoleum for Muhammad Ali Shah.
                    Until 1719, the subah of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a governor
                    appointed by the emperor. Persian adventurer Saadat Khan, also known as Burhan-ul-Mulk, was
                    appointed Nizam of Awadh in 1722 and established his court in Faizabad, near Lucknow.

                    Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established as the Mughal Empire disintegrated. The
                    third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula (r. 1753–1775), fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive
                    Nawab of Bengal, Mir Qasim. Roundly defeated at the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, he
                    was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender parts of his territory. Awadh's capital, Lucknow
                    rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab, shifted his court to the city from Faizabad
                    in 1775. The British East India Company appointed a resident (ambassador) in 1773 and by early
                    19th century gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were, however,
                    disinclined to capture Awadh outright and come face to face with the Maratha Empire and the remnants
                    of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the
                    British and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan take the throne. He
                    became a puppet king, and in a treaty of 1801, yielded large part of Awadh to the East India Company
                    while also agreeing to disband his own troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-controlled
                    army. This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal of the East India Company, although
                    it continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819. The treaty of 1801 proved a
                    beneficial arrangement for the East India Company as they gained access to Awadh's vast treasuries,
                    repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running
                    Awadh's armed forces brought them useful returns while the territory acted as a buffer state. The
                    Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the
                    British had grown impatient with the arrangement and demanded direct control over Awadh.


                    The ruins of the Residency at Lucknow show the gunfire it took during the rebellion.

                    Bada Imambada is famous for its maze called 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa' in Hindi-Urdu. It is built of
                    identical 2.5 feet wide passageways like the one shown in this photograph.
                    In 1856 the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state for
                    alleged maladministration. Awadh was placed under a chief commissioner – Sir Henry Lawrence. Wajid
                    Ali Shah, the then Nawab, was imprisoned, then exiled by the East India Company to Calcutta. In
                    the subsequent Indian Rebellion of 1857, his 14-year-old son Birjis Qadra, whose mother was Begum
                    Hazrat Mahal, was crowned ruler. Following the rebellion's defeat, Begum Hazrat Mahal and other
                    rebel leaders sought asylum in Nepal.

                    Lucknow was one of the major centres of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and actively participated in
                    India's independence movement, emerging as a strategically important North Indian city. During the
                    Rebellion (also known as the First War of Indian Independence and the Indian Mutiny), the majority
                    of the East India Company's troops were recruited from both the people and nobility of Awadh. The
                    rebels seized control of the state, and it took the British 18 months to reconquer the region.
                    During that period, the garrison based at the Residency in Lucknow was besieged by rebel forces
                    during the Siege of Lucknow. The siege was relieved first by forces under the command of Sir Henry
                    Havelock and Sir James Outram, followed by a stronger force under Sir Colin Campbell. Today, the
                    ruins of the Residency and the Shaheed Smarak offer an insight into Lucknow's role in the events of
                    1857.

                    With the rebellion over, Oudh returned to British governance under a chief commissioner. In 1877 the
                    offices of lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were
                    combined; then in 1902, the title of chief commissioner was dropped with the formation of the United
                    Provinces of Agra and Oudh, although Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.


                    Map of parts of the Old City and the Civil Station, ca 1914
                    The Khilafat Movement had an active base of support in Lucknow, creating united opposition to
                    British rule. In 1901, after remaining the capital of Oudh since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of
                    264,049, was merged into the newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. In 1920 the
                    provincial seat of government moved from Allahabad to Lucknow. Upon Indian independence in 1947, the
                    United Provinces were reorganised into the state of Uttar Pradesh, and Lucknow remained its
                    capital.

                    Lucknow witnessed some of the pivotal moments in the history of India. One is the first meeting of
                    the stalwarts Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohd Ali Jinnah during the Indian National
                    Congress session of 1916 (the Lucknow pact was signed and moderates and extremists came together
                    through the efforts of Annie Besant during this session only). The Congress President for that
                    session, Ambica Charan Majumdar in his address said that "If the Congress was buried at Surat, it is
                    reborn in Lucknow in the garden of Wajid Ali Shah".

                    The Kakori conspiracy involving Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Rajendra Nath Lahiri, Roshan
                    Singh and others followed by the Kakori trial which captured the imagination of the country also
                    took place in Lucknow.

                    Culturally, Lucknow has also had a tradition of courtesans, with popular culture distilling it
                    in the avatar of the fictional Umrao Jaan.

                    The Gomti River, Lucknow's chief geographical feature, meanders through the city and divides it into
                    the Trans-Gomti and Cis-Gomti regions. Situated in the middle of the Indus-Gangetic Plain, the city
                    is surrounded by rural towns and villages: the orchard town of Malihabad, Kakori, Mohanlalganj,
                    Gosainganj, Chinhat and Itaunja. To the east lies Barabanki, to the west Unnao, to the south
                    Raebareli, while to the north lie the Sitapur and Hardoi. Lucknow city is located in a seismic zone

                    Lucknow has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) with cool, dry winters from mid-November to
                    February and dry, hot summers with sunshine from March to mid-May. More than nine-tenths of the
                    annual rainfall occurs from June to October when the city receives an average of 827.2 millimetres
                    (32.57 in) from the southwest monsoon winds, although occasionally frontal rainfall from the
                    northeast monsoon will occur in January. In winter the maximum temperature is around 25 °C or 77 °F
                    and the minimum is in the 3 to 7 °C (37.4 to 44.6 °F) range. Fog is quite common from
                    mid-December to late January. Occasionally, Lucknow experiences colder winter spells than places
                    like Shimla and Mussoorie which are situated way high up in the Himalayas. In the extraordinary
                    winter cold spell of 2012–2013, Lucknow recorded temperatures below freezing point on two
                    consecutive days and the minimum temperature hovered around freezing point for over a week. Summers
                    are very hot with temperatures rising into the 40 to 45 °C (104 to 113 °F) range, the average maxima
                    being in the high 30s Celsius.
