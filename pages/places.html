                            La Martinière Boys' College was founded by an endowment from the wealthy eighteenth-century
                            Frenchman, Major-General Claude Martin (1735–1800), who was an officer in the French and
                            later the British East India Company. Martin acquired his fortune while serving
                            Asaf-ud-Daula, the nawab wazir of Awadh, and was reputedly the richest Frenchman in India.
                            Constantia, the palatial building which now houses the Boys' College, was built in 1785 as
                            Martin's country residence, but was not completed until 1802, two years after Martin's death
                            on 13 September 1800.

                            A dargah (Persian: درگاه dargâh or درگه dargah, Turkish: dergâh, Hindustani: dargah दरगाह
                            درگاہ, Bengali: দরগাহ dorgah) is a shrine or tomb built over the grave of a revered
                            religious figure, often a Sufi saint or dervish. Sufis often visit the shrine for ziyarat, a
                            term associated with religious visits and "pilgrimages". Dargahs are often associated with
                            Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called khanqah or hospices. They usually include
                            a mosque, meeting rooms, Islamic religious schools (madrassas), residences for a teacher or
                            caretaker, hospitals, and other buildings for community purposes.
                            The same structure, carrying the same social meanings and sites of the same kinds of ritual
                            practices, is called maqam in the Arabic-speaking world.

                            Begum Hazrat Mahal (c. 1820 – 7 April 1879), also known as the Begum of Awadh, was the
                            second wife of Nawab of Awadh Wajid Ali Shah, and the regent of Awadh in 1857–1858. She is
                            known for the leading role she had in the rebellion against the British East India Company
                            during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
                            After her husband had been exiled to Calcutta and the Indian Rebellion broke out, she made
                            her son, Prince Birjis Qadr, the Wali (ruler) of Awadh, with herself as regent during his
                            minority. However, she was forced to abandon this role after a short reign. She finally
                            found asylum in Nepal onto Hallaur, she died in 1879 Nepal. Her role in the rebellion has
                            given her a heroine status.

                        This church was built in 1860 but at that time it was small as compared to its present
                        architecture. With the passage of time, as Lucknow Cantonment began to expand, the number of
                        troops increased and the church was expanded to meet their needs. It was decided in 1908 that a
                        bigger church was extremely necessary. After the new church was reconstructed, it was
                        rechristened as All Saints New Garrison Church.

                        This was the first church to be built for the Anglican Church.[clarification needed] It was
                        designed in 1908 by a British Engineer named Jones Ransom, who has also made the design for the
                        Saint Mungo's Church of Scotland in Lucknow Cantonment. When he returned to England, the work
                        was completed by Lishman under the supervision of architect John Baggs.
                        The total cost incurred in the construction of this church was Rs. 91,000. The imposing
                        architecture of this church is inspired by Magdalen College, Oxford. Above the main door of the
                        church, situated in the west, is a tall tower which houses the church bell.

                        The main design of the church was prepared by Ransom, but after he moved to England, the
                        subsequent engineers made a few changes to the design. The tower was constructed a little
                        shorter than it was originally intended and the side walls were also reduced in thickness and
                        height, so that some savings could be done. The quadrangle of the church is also quite large and
                        has seating areas made out of ply. The prominent feature of these seats is that every bench has
                        a niche for keeping guns on the upper-back side.
